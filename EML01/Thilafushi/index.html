            <p class="main_text" style="color: rgb(180, 112, 10);"><strong><i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thilafushi"> Thilafushi</a></i></strong> originally was a lagoon called <em>"Thilafalhu"</em> with a length of 7 km and a width of 200 metres at the shallowest regions. It came into existence following a series of discussions and efforts to resolve Malé's garbage predicament during the early 1990s. The decision to reclaim Thilafalhu as a landfill was made on 5 December 1991.


            Thilafushi received its first load of <strong><i>garbage</i></strong> from Malé on 7 January 1992. Operations started with just 1 landing craft, 4 heavyload trucks, 2 excavators and a single wheel loader.</p>

            <p class="main_text" style="color: rgb(180, 112, 10);">During its early years of waste disposal operations, pits (also known as cells) with a volume of 37,500 ft3 (1060 m3) were dug, after which the sand obtained from the excavation was used to construct walled enclosures around the internal perimeter of the cells. Waste received from Malé was deposited into the midst of the pit, which was topped off with a layer of construction debris and then uniformly levelled with white sand. Initially there was no segregation of the waste since it had to be disposed immediately due to mass accumulation.</p>

            <p class="main_text" style="color: rgb(180, 112, 10);">Today Thilafushi has a landmass of more than 4.6 million ft2 (0.43 km²). The speedy terrestrial growth of Thilafushi was observed by the Government, and in November 1997, it was decided that land was to be leased to entrepreneurs interested in acquiring land for industrial purposes. Initially there were just 22 lease holders. Within the past 10 years, this number has doubled to 54 resulting in more than 1.2 million square feet (0.11 km² or 27.5 acres) of land being used currently, which generates an excess of 14 million Rufiyaa (about USD1,000,000.00) per annum. Soon after, an area of 0.2 km² (known as Thilafushi-2) was reclaimed using white sand as the filling material to provide terra firma for the more heavy industries.</p>

                <li><dt>Cement packing</dt></li>
                <dd>A cement is a binder, a chemical substance used for construction that sets, hardens, and adheres to other materials to bind them together.<br> Cement is seldom used on its own, but rather to bind sand and gravel (aggregate) together. Cement mixed with fine aggregate produces mortar for masonry, or with sand and gravel, produces concrete.<br> Concrete is the most widely used material in existence and is behind only water as the planet's most-consumed resource.</dd>
                <br>
                <li><dt>Methane gas bottling</dt></li>
                <dd>Methane (US: /ˈmɛθeɪn/ METH-ayn, UK: /ˈmiːθeɪn/ MEE-thayn) is a chemical compound with the chemical formula CH4 (one carbon atom bonded to four hydrogen atoms).<br> It is a group-14 hydride, the simplest alkane, and the main constituent of natural gas.<br> The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, although capturing and storing it poses technical challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure.</dd>

                <dt>A warehouse is a building for storing goods.[2][3] Warehouses are used by manufacturers, importers, exporters, wholesalers, transport businesses, customs, etc.<br> They are usually large plain buildings in industrial parks on the outskirts of cities, towns, or villages.</dt>
