    <h1>Enviromental Issues</h1>
    <p>Environmentalists say that more than 330 tonnes of rubbish is brought to Thilafushi a day, most of which comes from Malé. In 2005 it was estimated that 31,000 truckloads of garbage are transported to Thilafushi annually, where it is dumped in large piles and eventually used to reclaim land and increase the size of the island.[6] So much is being deposited that the island is growing at a rate of one square metre per day.[7]

        According to official statistics, a single tourist produces 3.5 kg of garbage a day, twice as much as someone from Malé and five times more than anyone from the rest of the Maldives archipelago. Altogether, that comes to "300 to 400 tons of trash" dumped on the island every day, according to Shina Ahmed, administration manager of the Thilafushi Corporation that runs the island.[8]
        
        Ali Rilwan, an environmentalist in Malé, said that "used batteries, asbestos, lead and other potentially hazardous waste mixed with the municipal solid wastes being put into the water. Although it is a small fraction of the total, these wastes are a source of toxic heavy metals and it is an increasingly serious ecological and health problem in the Maldives".[7][9] Bluepeace, the main ecological movement of the Maldives, has described the island as a "toxic bomb".[10]
        
        After reports of illegal dumping surfaced, management was transferred to Malé City Council to clear up confusion to who could be responsible for the waste.[11] The council signed a contract in 2011 with the Indian-based company, Tatva Global Renewable Energy to rehabilitate the island and manage the waste problem.[12] However, the deal was never implemented due to bureaucracy and political interference, ultimately cancelling it.[13]
        
        In December 2011 the Malé City Council temporarily banned the transporting of waste to Thilafushi because of a surge in waste floating in the island's lagoon and drifting out to sea.[14][15][16] The cause of the floating waste has been blamed on "impatient" boat captains unable to unload their waste.[17][18]
        
        In a BBC report in May 2012, the island of waste was described as "apocalyptic"</p>
